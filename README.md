# PacMen-Excercise-
The PaCMen excercise is about integrating PacMen images to create movement based on the end of the Page. Four images of PacMen are part of the Javascript and the edges of screen are detected for the image to function. Once the PacMen hit the edge of the screen, they flip to create another image going backward. In combination of four images, the animation is created with the user input of buttons.
